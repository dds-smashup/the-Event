## Sponsorship
In some normal hackathons, one or more sponsors have a proprietary interest in the process or products.  Sometimes they want to promote their products or services (e.g. “build a public health app using XYZ’s API and tools…”), or they are hoping to commercialize one or more prototypes, or maybe they want to recruit new employees.

By contrast, in the DDS Smashup all sponsorships will be for community benefit and for research goals. There will be no marketing sponsors and no formal job recruiting.

All sponsor money will be handled through the B-Sides LV non-profit organization (or similar).

All sponsor money will go for direct expenses for the venue, equipment, networking services, food, office supplies, etc.  No money will go to Organizers or Participants in the form of salaries or consulting fees.  Students and other limited income Participants may receive travel and expense stipends.
